<h2>Reading 1: How to Crit</h2>

<h3><strong>1. What are some challenges you face when giving a critique? </strong></h3>
<p> 
 Some challenges you face when giving a critique is that sometimes it can be misunderstood, harsh, and could hurt one’s feelings even though it was a critique that was meant for the individual to improve in a positive way. Giving feedback may also discourage the individual. As well as the person giving feedback may be incorrectly giving proper critiques. For example by making it too personal. Some may approach a problem with the individual's lack of skills rather than the work itself that needs improvement. Or, they are biased therefore the critiques only reflect on their taste and preference rather than the individual’s skills. Another example could be that some are too shy, to be honest, and straightforward so they only respond with positivity to avoid the negative, or critical issues. There are many more challenges that one can face by giving critiques, however, those are the main challenges that I personally have seen, and faced. 
</p>

 <h3><strong>2. How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?</strong></h3>
 <p>
When it comes to disagreeing in general you should state your critique respectfully without belittling, or shame the critique you disagree with. Some may respond defensively, which is something that you should try to avoid by having the intent of understanding. You should also try to find some aspect that you agree with if possible. If not, you can discuss your disagreement and explain why you disagree. By doing so, it will enable both sides to come together and have a better understanding of both reasons, which leads to growth and expands one’s perspective. However, handling a critique may depend on the intention of the critique received. For example, it may be a harmful critique as opposed to being effective. In this case, don’t let anger or negative emotions take over because it will not look professional. Instead, take your time and try to understand, discuss your reasonings, seek clarifications, and ask questions. 
</p>
<h3><strong>3.Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques? </strong></h3>
<p>
It's important to give and receive criticism because it allows you to see flaws that we were unaware of, improvements, and see things from a different perspective that can help us in the future. Giving criticism is as important as receiving critiques since it can change or expand one’s skills, views to do better. A critique is useful on any occasion such as draft work or final work because the information can be used as an advantage. Whether it is harsh or not, it gives you the advantage to get an insight or an answer on how to set things right and also might be a faster way to upgrade your work. It will lead you to think of how you work, how you can push yourself further, and discussions with your peers. It may create a safe space, with your peers whether it is in your workplace or classroom to open up and help each other grow.  </p>

<h2>Reading 2: What Screens Want</h2>

<h3><strong>1. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.</strong></h3>
<p> 
 I think that both are good and agree that it is for aesthetics. There is no such thing as because the screen is flat, designs should be flat. I don’t see any benefits of thinking that way, because it is very limiting. Both flat and skeuo serve as an aesthetic and it depends on what the user is building, goals and taste. Computing is pretty much limitless. That is because we can create and add so many features whether they are three-dimensional, or flat. This opens up more opportunities to be creative instead of thinking “screens are flat therefore designs should be flat.” If I were to choose between one of them, I’d choose skeuomorphism because it feels more real and gives a realistic touch to it. However, I noticed a lot of designs are now flat, such as apps (for example, the Instagram logo), to fit the modern era because of its simplicity and futuristic look.
</p>

 <h3><strong>2. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</strong></h3>
 <p>
Zoopraxiscope is an early device of motion pictures that Muybridge invented.  Muybridge printed sequences of high-speed photographs of galloping horses on a glass disc, then lit it up from behind as it was spinning to create motion. Zoopraxiscope is related to web and interactive design because the motion can create a natural interaction with the user. For example, it can navigate, organize, give visual responses through a screen with the user. This gives an in-depth- experience and a deeper level to the interaction design.  As well as it can make the experience memorable, by making the user feel like they are interacting with something. A website has features to make it intractable. An example could be the software Wix, where users can create websites for themselves. There are a lot of options. Such as adding animation, and motion to text, buttons, pictures, and many more that makes the experience interactive whether you are building the website or viewing a Wix website.
</p>

<h3><strong>3.Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not. </strong></h3>
<p>
I think it does because it’s more beneficial since “Flux” is the capacity for change (Frank Chimeno). "Flux" is an engaging tool that is interactive, and also convenient to the user. An example was the light changing website given from the article "What the screens want: by Frank Chimeno). This feature is very helpful because it automatically changes the color of the website to adjust at night which won't strain your eyes. I feel like screens without "Flux" aren't going to be interactive, which I think takes away being immersive when looking at a monitor, or phone.  It also adds a bit of personality, such as the OS X’s genie effect on window minimization that gives us a visualization that you minimized a screen. </p>

<h2>Reading 3: Touring Complete User</h2>

<h3><strong>1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</strong></h3>
<p> 
  I think that Lialina’s opinion of the word “user” should be preserved when they are interacting with the computers because she explains how the word “User” is becoming invisible or disappearing in terms of phenomena and the term itself.  That is because designers want to make the users forget about the interfaces and computers that exist and that being a user, is a reminder that they do in fact exist. For example, where Adobe introduced version 3 of Creative Suite. There is a particular video that translates you into thinking that you are creative when you think less about the web itself, scripts, links, and source codes. Lialina believes this is false and that I think Lialina wants the user to have a say in what kind of software or application they want to use rather than being told how to interact with their computers. It takes away an engaging experience for the user because the designers see users as “busy”.
</p>

 <h3><strong>2.What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</strong></h3>
 <p>
 	Some of the qualities that Lialina outlines for her ideal internet user are that the user must be involved and participate in what the user is engaging in, which is the General Purpose User, She wants the user to be able to make their own decisions without any suggestions from webs that basically guess what they may want or not. An example Lialina used is the “Google Maps + Google Video + Mashup — Claude Lelouch’s Rendezvous”, most likely made by a student.  It asks the user to syncs the video and map at the same time rather than being autoplay. This allows for users to be engaged with the technology, use their own intelligence, and have the ability to make their own choices instead of constantly being “guided” which implies users are unintelligent and stupid. This would also make the user think that the technology is not seen as a tool but because they are being involved, getting to interact with the mechanics of the technology.
</p>

<h3><strong>3.From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"? </strong></h3>
<p>
	I can’t remember any at the moment but one website that I recently used was called Big Cartel where you can sell artwork and support art businesses. It is basically a shopping website. Big Cartel has a customizable feature where you can change the look of your website shop with the options given. However, they also provide a syntax page that allows users to customize their site however they want. I’m not too sure about other shopping websites but I think this is a cool feature that allows users to express themselves and create a theme that fits what they’re selling. You can create discounts, and keep track of your stuff in the dashboard. It doesn't have any following or like features, but maybe in the syntax page, you may be able to add them.

<h2>Reading 4: My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge</h2>

<h3><strong>1. Why does Laurel Schwulst (Links to an external site.) advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</strong></h3>
<p> 
  Laurel explains how websites are better than social media, and that artists can control how they want to show their content. I agree and but mostly disagree with Laurel because not everyone has the time, nor the ability to create websites since they do not have knowledge of coding.  This only benefits people who have knowledge of coding and have creativity. Not everyone is willing to learn code, some may find it difficult to comprehend it,  or some simply just want a premade template for them. This is why social media platforms become useful for them, so they can share, post, message, do whatever they want despite being limited. I would say it’s better to have both so the people who want a website can learn and make one and the ones who do not can stick with social media.  However, I do agree that this would be great for artists to have control over the web because it would make the web a more interesting place for users to explore. 
</p>
<h3><strong>2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.</strong></h3>
