    <h3><strong>1. What are some challenges you face when giving a critique? </strong></h3>
    <p> 
     Some challenges you face when giving a critique is that sometimes it can be misunderstood, harsh, and could hurt one’s feelings even though it was a critique that was meant for the individual to improve in a positive way. Giving feedback may also discourage the individual. As well as the person giving feedback may be incorrectly giving proper critiques. For example by making it too personal. Some may approach a problem with the individual's lack of skills rather than the work itself that needs improvement. Or, they are biased therefore the critiques only reflect on their taste and preference rather than the individual’s skills. Another example could be that some are too shy, to be honest, and straightforward so they only respond with positivity to avoid the negative, or critical issues. There are many more challenges that one can face by giving critiques, however, those are the main challenges that I personally have seen, and faced.
